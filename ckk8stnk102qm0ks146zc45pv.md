By just pulling some quick descriptions of your target audience and the characteristics you would use to define them, you will be able to ascertain your audience.

### Step 3: Create Rules for Images

If you would like to have images on your blog, it would be great to know:
- Where the first image is placed in an article.
- Minimum and maximum sizes for images.
- How images are credited.
- What type of image you are using. 
- How captions should be formatted for each image.
 
### Step 4: Decide What Font Style and Font Sizes to Use.

- You should know the font family and font sizes that you’re working with. When picking fonts size on the article always make sure the bigger fonts go to the headings that you would like to be in noticed by your reader. Always use different sizes of the font for headings, another for subheadings, and a third for the main text.

**Use Short Sentences: ** 
Do not bore your readers with lengthy writings because not every reader enjoys lengthy articles. They make reading look stressful and boring especially if there are no images to accompany the content. Instead, go for short and direct sentences when writing, they’re easier to read and understand.

### Step 5: Create Rules Around Language and Tone.

- **American English or British English:** 
Who your primary target audience are determines the English you would likely use? But then write in British  English because they’re most common.

- **Adult language:**
It is assumed that a professional blog never has swear words or harsh words, but there are certain blogs that used minimal swearing to a great effect. Whether you want to use adult language on your blog or not is determined by the audience you are writing for and the content of your blog.

- **Abbreviation**: 
Decide on the use of acronyms, if any is to be used, and how they must appear. In cases of formal writing, it is best to write the full meaning of each abbreviation that you decide to use. Just so readers who do not know what the abbreviation stands for can also get to know. Since the purpose of writing is to communicate and not impress, simple words work better than big complex words.

- **Numbers:**
Although opinions vary on this one, you should spell out all single-digit numbers and leave the rest as numerals. It is expected to spell out every number less than 100. 
- **Sourcing:**
 How do you give credit to where you found your information? 
 Do you like referencing resources that were helpful at the end of the article?.  
Perhaps you prefer quoting other writers or tagging them within the paragraphs of the article?.

### Step 6: Formatting.

When you are done writing and are formatting the article, the blogs CSS should handle the format you follow when organizing your content?. 
- Do you prefer more emojis, or pictures, or gif, or quotes?.
- How should you use headings? 
- When is bold okay to use?
- When are italics okay to use?
- Is strikethrough allowed?
 Whichever format you use in the style guide should be maintained in every article.
 
### step 7: Develop a Release Schedule.

The idea of having a schedule for writing is to make you consistent with your publication. And to also give your audience an idea of when to expect a blog post from you. You should have a particular day you within a week you publish an article, that way, your readers who must have subscribed to your mailing list get notified once you make a publication. The pillars of a great blog are consistency and quality therefore, having a consistent voice will help readers connect with your brand.
