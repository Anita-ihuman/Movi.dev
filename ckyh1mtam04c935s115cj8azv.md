The Kyverno Certification contains a multiple-choice quiz exam, testing your entry-level knowledge and skills in policy management using Kyverno.

This Certification is intended to enhance your knowledge of Kyverno and cluster management in cloud-native environments. It provides the best-in-class policy management training with industry best practices; to help practitioners confidently manage the security, compliance and operational benefits that cloud-native environments offer.

### Kubernetes Fundamental Certified (KFC)

The certification program currently has just one course available, which is the [Kyverno Fundamentals Certification](https://learn.nirmata.com/courses/kyverno-fundamentals-certification). This course is designed for existing and aspiring developers, administrators, architects, and managers who handle clusters in the cloud-native environment. It consists of reading lists from both Kyverno and Kubernetes documentation on; introduction to policy management, Kyverno basics & how to install it, writing Kyverno policies, and sample policies.

**Specific knowledge tested in the Fundamental Certification for Kyverno quiz exam includes:**

*   Understanding the basics of Kyverno 30%
*   Installation of Kyverno 15%
*   Understanding Policies Definitions 40%
*   Kyverno Sample policies 15%

### Questions Deemed “hard” in this Certification.

Although the Kyverno fundamentals certification focuses on the basics of Kyverno and policy definition, some quiz questions have been highlighted by the past participant and are considered tricky. These questions consume more thinking time and participants to have an in-depth understanding of the resources provided in the reading list.

#### Some of the questions considered challenging include:

> 1\. Kyverno pod security policies (select all that apply):

> a. Implement the Kubernetes Pod Security Standards

> b. Can’t be used with the Pod Security Admission Controller

> c. Doesn’t perform additional checks

This question was derived from resources on [Kyverno sample policies](https://kyverno.io/policies/) and can be found in the reading list.

> 2\. Which type of patching is deprecated and scheduled for removal in Kyverno:

> a. RFC JSON 6902

> b. Strategic Merge

> c. Overlay pattern

> 3\. Verifying image signatures with Kyverno requires:

> a. Additional plug-ins to be installed

> b. An OCI compliant registry

> c. Sigstore and Fulcio

The quiz questions 2 & 3 are derived focused on writing Kyverno [policy definition,](https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/) and resources on this can be found in the reading list.
